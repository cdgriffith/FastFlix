## Staying legal

Licencing is a pain, but it keeps everyone compliant and out of trouble. I try to make life easy for everyone
by releasing my own software as MIT licences, which the code itself is.

However that is not possible when bundling an executable. Hence why the Linux and Mac versions are not bundled at all.
The windows releases are LGPL, as they are bundled with pyside2 during packaging.

### Development

#### Windows

You will need `pywin32`, I use the precompiled binaries from "https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs"
