# FastFlix

FastFlix is a super simple converter and clip maker.

It is designed to work with ffmpeg with x265 support or an equivalent command line tool.

They are expected to be found via the system path or specified on startup via `FFMPEG` and `FFPROBE` env variables.

# Releases

## Setting up ffmpeg

There are three ways provided a path to ffmpeg. 

1. Looks in the FFMPEG and FFPROBE environment variables
2. Looks on the system PATH to see if it is already available
3. Manually link to the directory housing the binary files via the GUI
