# FastFlix

![preview](./docs/gui_preview.png)

FastFlix is a simple and friendly GUI for encoding videos.

[Download latest release from Github](https://github.com/cdgriffith/FastFlix/releases/latest)

FastFlix keeps HDR10 metadata for x265, which will be expanded to AV1 libraries when available.

It needs `FFmpeg` (version 4.3 or greater) under the hood for the heavy lifting, and can work with a variety of encoders.

# Releases

View the [releases](https://github.com/cdgriffith/FastFlix/releases) for binaries for Windows, MacOS or Linux

You will need to have `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` executables on your PATH and they must be executable. Version 4.3 or greater is required. The one in your in your package manager system may not support all encoders or options.
Check out the [FFmpeg download page for static builds](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) for Linux and Mac.

## Running from source code

Requires python3.8+

```
git clone https://github.com/cdgriffith/FastFlix.git
cd FastFlix
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m fastflix
```

# HDR

On any 10-bit or higher video output, FastFlix will copy the input HDR colorspace (bt2020). Which is [different than HDR10 or HDR10+](https://codecalamity.com/hdr-hdr10-hdr10-hlg-and-dolby-vision/).

## HDR10

FastFlix was created to easily extract / copy HDR10 data, but as of sept 2020, only x265 support copying that data through FFmpeg, no AV1 library does.

VP9 has limited support to copy some existing HDR10 metadata, usually from other VP9 files. Will have the line "Mastering Display Metadata, has_primaries:1 has_luminance:1 ..." when it works.

* rav1e -  can set mastering data and CLL via their CLI but [not through ffmpeg](https://github.com/xiph/rav1e/issues/2554).
* SVT AV1 - accepts a "--enable-hdr" flag that is [not well documented](https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/SVT-AV1/blob/master/Docs/svt-av1_encoder_user_guide.md), not supported through FFmpeg.
* aomenc (libaom-av1) - does not look to support HDR10

## HDR10+

FastFlix supports using generated or [extracted JSON HDR10+ Metadata](https://github.com/cdgriffith/FastFlix/wiki/HDR10-Plus-Metadata-Extraction) with HEVC encodes via x265. However, that is highly
dependent on a FFmpeg version that has been compiled with x265 that has HDR10+ support. [BtbN's Windows FFmpeg builds](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds) 
have this support as of 10/23/2020 and may require a [manual upgrade](https://github.com/cdgriffith/FastFlix/wiki/Updating-FFmpeg).

If you add HDR10+ metadata file, make sure the encoding log does NOT contain the line `x265 [warning]: –dhdr10-info disabled. Enable HDR10_PLUS in cmake` or else it is unsupported. 

## HLG 

FastFlix (v4.0.2+) passes through HLG color transfer information to everything except webp and GIF. 

## Dolby Vision

FastFlix does not plan to support Dolby Vision's proprietary format at this time.
